ALGM is a governance token of the Algem platform. ALGM will be primarily used in the following functions:
- As an additional incentive for locking;
- For staking. Users will earn part of the Algem’s dApp revenue (ASTR + ALGM) via ALGM staking;
- Voting on upgrades (add a new vault, change dApp parameters and fees, etc.)
F
ollowing Astar Network’s values, we decided not to make any of our governance tokens available for sale to the community. At Algem, we believe that ALGM should only be distributed to users and supporters of our project. The only way to receive governance tokens before they will be listed on exchanges is to lock ASTR or get an airdrop.

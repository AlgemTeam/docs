**Q: What is the difference between the vault types?**

**Type 1:** user gets incentive rewards on a weekly basis. The incentive rewards are liquid and can be used immediately. In case of premature withdrawal the user will pay a penalty, charged from the initial deposit.
**Type 2:** user gets incentive rewards on a weekly basis, but this reward goes to his treasury (Only 20% of ALGM of the whole incentive rewards are available immediately). The user can claim all tokens from the treasury only after the end of a deposit period. In case of the premature withdrawal the user will receive 100% of the initial deposit, but he loses all tokens from the treasury.

**Q: Can I close my deposit before the maturity date?**

Yes. In this case you will pay a penalty. More information about penalties can be found on the pages about vault types. 

**Q: Which token will I receive via ALGM staking?**

The biggest part of the dApp revenue (Fees + B2E reward) is represented by ASTR tokens. Small part, which comes from the penalties pool of the second type vaults, in ALGM tokens. 
So, your staking reward will consist of  approximately 99% ASTR tokens and 1% (or even less) ALGM tokens. 

**Q: What if I unstake ALGM before the end of the cycle?**

You will receive all the reward, which you had accumulated during this cycle, but only after his end. 

**Q: Is nASTR sufficiently backed by ASTR?**

In fact, nASTR is over-collateralized. Anytime a user makes a deposit, Deposit Notes Tokens (DNT) are minted (nASTR for ASTR, etc.). The difference is the amount of nASTR in different vault types. Example: if the user makes a 1000 ASTR deposit in the first type vault (T1V) for the 100 days, he will receive 900 nASTR immediately. Remaining 100 nASTR will be unlocked day-by-day during the 100 days and can be claimed manually every day. 

In case of the second type vault (T2V), the user will receive 1000 nASTR immediately. 

So, because of this difference between the vault types we will have the situation when, for example, 1 000 000 ASTR are locked, but there are only 850 000 nASTR existing.

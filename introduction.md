Algem is a chain-specific DeFi dApp that will allow users to hold their tokens (ASTR in a first term, SDN, tokens, DOT, other L1 tokens (wrapped), etc.) on the various relatively long timeframes and get rewards.

Algem is based on the time preference conception (invest today to earn and consume much more in the future), and will let users hold their tokens longer without additional doubts.

Deposit Notes Token (DNT) is a liquid representation of the locked tokens (nASTR in case of ASTR tokens). This is an important part of Algem, which helps users stay liquid during the lock and earn extra income.

Every time a user makes a deposit, DNTs are minted. These tokens represent the userâ€™s share in every Vault and rights to claim the underlying token back. 

After the launch of the first iteration, users can use DNTs outside Algem in our partners dApps (for staking, lending/borrowing, LP, etc.)

During the second iteration, we will concentrate on the development of the infrastructure to use DNTs inside Algem. We call it DNTs market with these use cases:
- Buy or sell DNTs;
- Use DNTs as a collator. Users can take loans against their DNTs if they think they can use their credit money more efficiently, than a loan percentage rate;
- Swap (our AMM).

Our goal is to provide as many use cases for the DNTs as possible to help our users earn more while their underlying assets are locked.
